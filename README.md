# STSdemo1
Demo code in Spring Tool Suite

I've created this code using Spring Boot Quick Start Guide at https://spring.io/quickstart
Then, I followed the instructions on this video to upload the project to GitHub: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPPpjQ7TG2w
Lastly I'm looking at the GitHub Guide Hello World to create a branch, at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
